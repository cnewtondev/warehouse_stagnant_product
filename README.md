This project takes in two different reports.

First report includes Product Number/type, How much of that Product came in, When that product was scanned in

Second report includes Product Number, How many were scanned out for shipment, When it was scanned out, and
what variable did that product ship to. In this case, a company

It will then parse that csv data and find out how long that product sat in warehouse, find average time, then
find out what variable is the culprate of stagnant product in the warehouse, and how often that variable offends
or goes over that average.

This way company can be weary of customers or clients that often cause stagnated or slow moving inventory in their
warehouses. Hope this helps!
